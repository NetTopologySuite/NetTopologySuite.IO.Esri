# Deprecated tests

Here you can find test ported from [NetTopologySuite.IO.ShapeFile 
repository](https://github.com/NetTopologySuite/NetTopologySuite.IO.ShapeFile/tree/e5cea1013adc51232a2124eecc903efaa23e192d/test).
Most of those tests refer to an issue on [NetTopologySuite.IO.ShapeFile](https://github.com/NetTopologySuite/NetTopologySuite.IO.ShapeFile) repository.
There are also tests created before the *ShapeFile* project was split out on its own from the
[NetTopologySuite](https://github.com/NetTopologySuite/NetTopologySuite/commit/540a32566f1e57a611e12b44d4162fdb1515aa04)
repository. Tests related to *NetTopologySuite.IO.ShapeFile* repository have an issue number marked with `ShapeFileIssueNumberAttribute` 
and tests related to *NetTopologySuite* repository have an issue number marked with `NtsIssueNumberAttribute`. 


All new tests should have an issue number marked with `EsriIssueNumberAttribute`.
